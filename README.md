# notes-app

Hello World, sziasztok (Hungarian)!

This is my main ongoing showcase project as a junior full-stack developer, finishing at the bootcamp [Codecool](https://codecool.com/at/) in Austria.

## User story ##
I'm fond of taking notes. Everywhere. Notes are great to secure our recurring and often important but volatile thoughts. By doing so we can lean back and relax, because we can be sure that we aren't going forget a thing. Or are we? Well, notes often get out of hand when we mix up topics and start using different platforms, not to mention using multiple digital and tangible (physical) notebooks. There are for sure no surefire solution as all kinds of notebooks have their pros and cons. I'm still attempting to create one digital notebook for myself. Maybe I'll be (hopefully positively) surprised at the end. 

**Summary**: I as a private person need a simple, secure and customized digital note-taking app to help me navigate in today's information overloaded world.
